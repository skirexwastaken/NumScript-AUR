# NumScript: A Numerical Programming Language

NumScript is a **lightweight, esoteric, interpreted scripting language** designed for **numerical programming** and writing simple scripts.

The language started as a joke back in **mid-2024**, and over time it grew into its current form featuring a **rich syntax** and a **unique numerical logic system**.

👉 You can try the language at [**numscript.xyz**](https://numscript.xyz)

## Key Features

NumScript includes several defining features that shape its unique programming model:
13 01 00 24 01 00
- **Token-Based Syntax:** All instructions are built using numeric token pairs (for example, `13 01`).
- **Zero-Error Policy:** NumScript never crashes. Mistyped or incomplete code automatically defaults to safe (though possibly unintended) behavior.
- **Real-Time Execution:** The interpreter processes code one line at a time, providing immediate feedback.
- **Simplicity:** NumScript features a minimalistic syntax and a limited set of data types, resulting in a lightweight and efficient programming experience.

## Requirements

NumScript doesn't use any non standard Python libraries so you will need to simply install Python. Bellow are the versions of Python that I've tried so far.

| Works | Python Version |
|-------|----------------|
| ✅ | 3.14.0 |
| ✅ | 3.13.7 |

## How to use

Running NumScript shell:

### Windows

`python NumScript.py`

### Linux 

`python3 NumScript.py`

Running NumScript file:

### Windows 

`python NumScript.py main.ns`

### Linux

`python3 NumScript.py main.ns`

## Core Mechanics

NumScript is an **interpreted language**, meaning the interpreter reads and executes code **one line at a time**.

The internal execution process is composed of several steps:

### 1. Tokenization
The code is first processed by a **tokenizer**, which checks that its content is numeric and splits it into **token pairs** — for example: "10", "01", "00"

    ### 2. Execution Setup
    After the instruction 00 (RUN) is passed, the code is compiled into a simplified internal format and sent to the executor.
    The executor reads each line in order and passes it to the code runner.
    
    ### 3. Parsing
    The code runner sends the current line to the parser.
    The parser analyzes the tokens to determine which function should be executed — this is defined by the first token pair.
    That first pair is then removed, and the remaining tokens are passed to the lexer for further analysis.
    
    ### 4. Lexing
    The lexer processes the remaining tokens and groups them into Lexer Blocks, which represent final, usable values.
    In NumScript, these blocks are separated by the token 24.
    
    Example — Variable Definition: 13 01 00 24 01 01 01 00
    
    This expression contains two blocks:
    
    The first block defines the variable name, with the value 00.
    The second block defines the value of that variable, with the value 01 10.
    
    These blocks are then passed back to the parser and they are used as parameters in the executed function.
    
    ### 5. Execution Result
    The parser assigns the blocks as parameters for the target function, and the result is printed to the console.
    
    ### Summary
    Tokenizer -> Splits code into numeric token pairs.
    
    Executor -> Reads and sends each line for execution.
    
    Parser -> Determines which function each token pair represents and sets its arguments.
    
    Lexer -> Groups tokens into logical blocks and evaluates their values.
    
    Console Output -> Displays the final result after execution.
    
    ## Runtime Architecture
